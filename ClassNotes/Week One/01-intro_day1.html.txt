    Visit a couple of your favorite websites and see if you can identify some of the HTML elements that we discussed today - header, headings and paragraphs.

    If needed, write down what your user experience is like as you are interacting with the sites. i.e.: what happens when I hover over this, what happens when I click on that.

    These are everyday interactions that we have with webpages only now we are training ourselves to think why certain HTML elements behave the way they do.
