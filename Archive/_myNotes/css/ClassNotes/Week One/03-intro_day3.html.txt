      /* In CSS, we have a few properties that can define rules for all four sides of a box or an individual side. A few of these properties include margin, padding and border.

      Using margin as an example below but the same concept can be applied to padding and border

      margin: 50px
        :: Defines 50 pixel margin on the top, right, bottom and left sides of a box

      margin: 10px 5px 50px 20px

        :: Defines the following in clockwise order:
            10px margin on the top of a box,
            5px margin on the right of a box,
            50px maring on the bottom of a box,
            20px border on the left of a box

      margin: 10px 25px
        :: Defines the following:
            10px margin on the top and bottom of a box,
            20px margin on the left and right of a box

      Defining indiviual sides:
        margin-right: 0;
        margin-left: 0;
        margin-top: 0;
        margin-bottom: 50px;

      <!-- <p>this is a short paragraph</p>
        "this is a short paragraph" text is wrapped with <p> tags

          <p><i>shorter</i> paragraph</p>
          "shorter paragraph" text is wrapped in <p> tags, but  "shorter" is also wrapped in <i> tags.

          This structure is also know to have a parent-child relationship in html, where one element is nested inside of another



          ie:
          Here <main> has two child elements, that is the two <section> tags.
          Similarly both <section> tags have parent-child relationship with <p> tags
          A sibling relationship also exists here amongst the two <section> tags
          <main>
            <section><p>...</p></section>
            <section><p>...</p></section>
          </main>
