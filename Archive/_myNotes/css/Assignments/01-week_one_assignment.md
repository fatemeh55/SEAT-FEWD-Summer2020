### Week one mini assignment:

Create a web page of an activity that might require the use of an unordered list, an ordered list, and paragraph(s) for context. We created a recipe in class but it can be any activity you would like.

Use ancohor tags to link to external content and one or more image tags to add a photographic component(s) to your project. Also make use of heading tags, bold and italicized text. You are welcomed to use the .css document in our codesandbox project in your own project. Feel free to change any of the values to see how it changes your own document.

We'll revisit our projects on Tuesday, where we'll all (including me) have an opportunity to share and discuss our projects as a group, some of the challenges you came across during your project and how you overcame those challenges.
